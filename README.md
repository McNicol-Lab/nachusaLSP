# nachusaLSP

**Fork:** Updated algorithms (July 2025) to derived a land surface phenology product from PlanetScope imagery for Nachusa Grasslands. Data developed and initially shared for wetland methane research applications in the McNicol ecophilab, the ESIIL AI for Natural Methane Working Group, and the USGS Powell Synthesis for Wetlands.

Presently, the pipeline generate daily pixel-wise EVI after PS processing, filtering and gap-filling using smooth spline. These procedures could be revised and improved.

To run updated code:  

- Clone the repo into your workspace
- Create directories listed at top of `file = "pipeline/lsp-parameters.json"` and updated filepaths 
- Use `00_img_download.py` to retrieve data via PlanetScope API into created `rawImage` dir
- Run series of 5 processing scripts
- Ignore `pipeline/validation` and `pipeline/timeseries` for downstream analysis/time series retention
- Downstream `workflows`:
  
  * `nc-check-populate.Rmd` to output standardized .nc phenometric files per site per year (2021-2024)
  * `core-site-selection.Rmd` to identify suitable sites with good coverage for analysis
  * `review-final-wetlsp.Rmd` to inspect phenometric products by site-year and observeed and gap-filled values by site
  * `wetlsp-timeseries.Rmd` to create fetch perimeter, extract and retain pixel-wise EVI (obs & filled) in .RDS 
  * `review-fetch-rds.Rmd` to inspect the fetch perimeter and visualize/explore .RDS object
 
Quirks:
* `_gm_v1` workflow skips water mask steps in `03_LSP_script`, should not break process, but use if available
